this is a payment API that is connected to MYSQL database.

this API ensures data consistency and prevents partial operations. Idempotency keys are used to ensure money doesn't double withdraw.
in database there is tiggers that will set the new balance with money is withdraw or send, and set the status to success and the type is 
deposit or withdraw but in this api it will always be withdraw.

index used in here to resolve user id and joins was used to get the information that is scattered around other tables.

ACID also was used:
Everything succeeds or everything fails & Data must always follow valid rules balance that is have less the the stock price will not succeed & Two transactions should not affect each other’s results & Once committed, data will not disappear even if server crashes.

SQL join was used to return:
	    'account_id', 'card_id', 'balance', 'link_id'.

distributed system is also is there this API is connected to a website for payment acting as service 2. They communicate through HTTP requests
